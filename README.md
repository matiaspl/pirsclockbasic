PiRSClock-Basic
==============

PiRSClock-Basic is a Raspberry Pi Radio Studio Clock written in python using pygame. It will display the time full screen on any size monitor in the format recognised by the broadcast industry.

This was designed specifically for the Raspberry Pi but can be used with most computers with Linux installed. Future versions will include indicators for microphones, telephones etc... for use in a radio studio.

<h3>Development Status</h3>
PiRSClock-Basic is currently stable and ready for use where needed.

<h3>Installation for Raspberry Pi</h3>
It's recommended to use Debian Wheezy or above for this project.
For reliability I recommend to only use this Pi for the clock.
